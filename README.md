> This is intended as a boilerplate project. It comes with a few loaders and templates built already to give examples of how to use this static site generator.

## Scripts

```
npm run dev
```

> This spins up an Express server where you can access your site.

```
npm run build
```

> This will statically generate your site, and dump it in a build directory.
